# textbook-code

This repository contains code examples used in
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
by Christopher A. Bohn.

I have collected the examples into this repository so that instructors may
easily demonstrate the code in class and so that students may compile and run
the code themselves. You may, of course, simply copy the code out of the
publication and paste it into your favorite editor. I hope that you find
having the code in this repository to be more convenient.

The directories `chap01`, `chap02`, ..., `chap12` correspond to the chapters
in the publication. If you are looking for code examples from chapter *NN*,
you will find them in the `chapNN` directory.
