# textbook-code

This repository contains code examples used in
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
by Christopher A. Bohn.

I have collected the examples into this repository so that instructors may
easily demonstrate the code in class and so that students may compile and run
the code themselves. You may, of course, simply copy the code out of the
publication and paste it into your favorite editor. I hope that you find
having the code in this repository to be more convenient.

The directories `chap01`, `chap02`, ..., `chap12` correspond to the chapters
in the publication. If you are looking for code examples from chapter *NN*,
you will find them in the `chapNN` directory.

- The [license](LICENSE.md) for the software in this repository is, for all
  intents and purposes the MIT license; however, there is a subtle difference.
  [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) explicitly states that Great River Learning is not
  required to include the software's copyright notice in *Programming at the
  Hardware/Software Interface*. The reproduction of these code examples in
  *Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface* is governed by a different

- The publication *Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface* is not a 
  documentation file that is part of the Software, within the
  [license](LICENSE.md)'s meaning. It is a separate publication that makes
  use of these code examples.
